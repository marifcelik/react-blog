# MERN Blog project

You can start the project by simply running `start.sh` file. If you want to add an user and some data to the database, you can add `--init` flag to the command.

```bash
./start.sh --init
```

It will add an user with the `{username: 'user1', password: '123123'}` and 14 posts to the database.
